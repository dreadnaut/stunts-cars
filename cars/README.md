# Car files

Cars go in here, under their four-character id directory.

For each car:

- a `<WXYZ>.yaml` file containing
    - important attributes, to be standardised
    - a brief description of the car
- an `images` directory with screenshots or other images of the car
    - limit dimensions to 800Ã—800 or a similar small size?
    - standard names and formats might emerge (e.g., `side.png`)
- a `resources` directory containing all the car files
- an optional `history` directory, containing subdirectories for previous
  versions of the car
