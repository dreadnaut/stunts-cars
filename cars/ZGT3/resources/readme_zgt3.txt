*** LWT-ZR1 GT3 Mark II ***
	for Stunts 1.1 - by Duplode

General info: 
This is a tuned car for Stunts that aims to fill the gap between the (in)famous
powerslide cars (Ferrari GTO, Countach) and the IMSA class, providing a 
somewhat faster alternative to the road cars without the facile, slide-less
handling typical of IMSA cars. The whole design concept evolves from this 
notion of an IMSA/road car hybrid, and thus the car was modeled as a 
GT3-homologated tuning of the Corvette ZR1, the original car which lends itself
better to Gran Turismo-stlye racing mods. By the way, in common parlance it
is recommended to refer to the car as ZR1 GT3, or simply GT3, in order to avoid
confusion . As the name suggests, there was a Mark I edition before the current
Mark II; and there is also an older version of Mark II lacking the graphical
mods, as it was released before the wonderful modding tools by dstien were 
created. This release supersedes all older versions; details are provided
ahead.

Usage and distribution:
By the community, for the community. Feel free to make use of those files and
redistribute them as you wish. I only ask that, in case the car is made
available publicly for download, this readme gets bundled toegether with the
files.

Installation:
Extract all files (CARZGT3.RES, STDAZGT3.VSH, STDBZGT3.VSH and STZGT3.3SH) to
your Stunts 1.1 folder. If you have the older Mark II version (with the standard
ZR1 car body graphics) be sure to remove the STDAZGT3.PVS, STDBZGT3.PVS and 
STZGT3.P3S from the game folder, as well as overwriting the CARZGT3.RES (the
only changes done to the .RES were on gear knob coordinates and scoreboard text
fields, so your old Mark II replays will work properly with the new version).
The Mark I version is accounted as a different car altogether (initials LWZR),
and will not be overwriten by the current version in the odd case you have it.
Note that due to graphic file formats incompatibilities the car won't load 
properly on 1.0 versions of the game (you might even try to use CARZGT3.RES with 
a different set of graphic files, but the car performance will not be the same).

Features:
- Realistic torque curve, adapted from real data for the BMW V10 S85 engine used
on the M5;
- 6-speed gearbox, tuned for rapid-fire shifting between 2nd and 5th gears;
- Racing modification of the original Corvette body, including a bi-colour 
painting scheme;
- Customized dashboard layout based on the Ferrari GTO's;
- Accurate analog dashboard meters.

Available colour schemes:
- Dark Red/Dark Green
- Silver/Dark Red
- Blue/White
- Green/Black
- Red/Yellow
- Violet/Golden
- Yellow/Dark Blue

Performance data:
- 0-60mph  : 4.8s
- 0-100mph : 7.2s
