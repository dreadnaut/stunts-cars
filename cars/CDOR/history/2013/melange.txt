After two failed trys born this beauty called Melange XGT-88.
It have a similar performance of an IMSA car, but I built it taking codes from Countach, Lamborghini LM-002, Corvette, Porsche 962, Jaguar, Acura NSX, and the rest was made by me. The rev meter was adapted to the dashboard and for the car exigences. The height was changed too. It's a little bit higher than the IMSA cars but not as higher as the others. 
This car is driveable with automatic  or manual transmission and it's 100% secure (I mean you won't find bugs or unexpected reactions).
